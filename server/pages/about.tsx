    <h1>About the Turtle System</h1>
    <p>
      The <i>Turtle System</i> is based on <i>Turtle Graphics</i>, an idea
      invented by Seymour Papert, in which an imaginary turtle moves around the
      computer screen drawing as it goes, all under the control of instructions
      given by a computer program. This sort of programming, and the results it
      produces, are easy to understand because they are so immediately visual.
      But the <i>Turtle System</i> provided here shows that Papert&lsquo;s idea
      can go well beyond simple graphics, to provide a basis for fascinating and
      powerful programs that introduce fundamental concepts of software
      engineering and artificial intelligence.

    <h2>Turtle Graphics and Beyond</h2>
    <p>
      Computer programming can be tremendous fun, as well as educational. And
      the best way to start learning to program is indeed to have fun: to
      experience the pleasure of intellectual creativity as you capture your
      imaginative ideas in computer code. Unfortunately, the sophistication of
      many programming systems gets in the way here, with lots of new concepts
      and techniques required before the novice is able to apply any creative
      ideas. To get over this daunting hurdle, it is helpful to start
      programming in a system which is intuitively &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, and
      where technical complications are kept to a minimum. A wonderful way of
      achieving this&mdash;which has since been very widely copied&mdash;was
      invented by Seymour Papert with his idea of <i>Turtle Graphics</i>, based
      on the metaphor of a turtle moving around the computer screen and drawing
      as it goes, all under the control of instructions given by a computer
      program. This sort of programming, and the results it produces, are easy
      to understand because they are so immediately visual.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who want to learn more about how computers work, the{" "}
      <i>Turtle System</i> provided here goes well beyond the basics of
      programming in Turtle Graphics, by including a facilities to &ldquo;see
      under the bonnet&rdquo; of a computer. The system incorporates a{" "}
      <i>visual compiler</i> which translates the written program into a form of
      &ldquo;machine code&rdquo; for a virtual <i>Turtle Machine</i> (when the
      program runs, it is this compiled &ldquo;machine code&rdquo; that is
      actually executed). Since the Turtle Machine supports parameterised
      procedures with full recursion, this gives an opportunity to learn about a
      fascinating topic which is usually confined to advanced university
      courses, but entirely accessible (though not easy) when presented in this
      way.

    <p>
      The principles behind the <i>Turtle System</i> were explained in Peter
      Millican&rsquo;s 2004 research thesis, which discusses much of the
      relevant pedagogical literature, as well as providing technical details
      and results from teaching experience:

    <h2>Praise for the Turtle System</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The <i>Turtle System</i> is a wonderful educational tool to develop
        young people&rsquo;s thinking, giving a vision of the beauty and joy of
        Computer Science by offering a very approachable introduction to
        programming and much more. It connects the commands children write with
        the underlying instructions given to the machine that executes them, to
        satisfy the inquiring mind that constantly asks &lsquo;how do they do
        that?&rsquo; The <i>Turtle System</i> makes real the connection between
        programming languages and machine code in a way that I have never seen
        in any other educational package, giving a more complete understanding
        of the processes involved, language translation and the fundamental
        notion of abstraction. It is deep stuff, that can be delved into at
        different levels with different ages, and I&rsquo;d love to see it more
        widely used.
