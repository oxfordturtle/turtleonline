    <h3>Programs and Procedures: the Basics</h3>
    <p>The simplest BASIC programs take this form:</p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">REM [program commands] END</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The first couple of Turtle example programs (from the Examples menu) are
      like this. But the ‘Olympic rings’ program introduces a global variable:
      it is called <code data-language="BASIC">ringsize%</code> and specifies
      the size of the rings. Such variables are ‘declared’ by assigning a value,
      like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">
        ringsize% = 130 REM [other program commands] END
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Complicated programs are usually divided into subroutines, to separate the
      various tasks and make them easier to understand. BASIC has two types of
      subroutine, procedures (which are like mini-programs) and functions (which
      are designed to calculate some value).
    </p>
    <p>
      The ‘Simple procedure’ example program has a procedure to draw a ‘prong’ –
      a line ending in a blot – and then return to the starting point.
      Procedures fit into a BASIC program after the end of the main program,
      indicated by <code data-language="BASIC">END</code>. They look like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">
        DEF PROCmyprocedure(par1%) LOCAL local1%, local2$ REM [procedure
        commands] ENDPROC
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      All procedure names must begin with ‘PROC’, e.g.{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">PROCmyprocedure</code>. A procedure can have
      its own local variables, declared using{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">LOCAL</code>. A{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">PRIVATE</code> variable is declared the same
      way, but unlike a <code data-language="BASIC">LOCAL</code> variable, it
      retains its value between procedure calls. A procedure can also have
      parameters (or ‘arguments’) that are values sent into the subroutine when
      it is called from the program, and given a name within the subroutine
      (e.g. <code data-language="BASIC">par1%</code> above).
    </p>
    <p>
      A function is similar to a procedure, with the addition that it returns a
      value. Also a function name must begin with ‘FN’, for example:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">
        DEF FNmyfunction$(par1%) REM [procedure commands] = "output"
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The last statement of a function always begins with{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">=</code> and the{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">"output"</code> provides the return value for
      the function. If a function returns a string (as above), then its name
      must end with <code data-language="BASIC">$</code>; otherwise an integer
      return type will be assumed.
    </p>

    <h4>Reserved Words, Declarations, Types, and Variables</h4>
    <p>
      The words <code data-language="BASIC">REM</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">END</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">DEF</code>, etc. are all capitalized to
      emphasise the program structure. BASIC takes notice of capitalization.
      These three words are also in red here (or gray for comments) – this is to
      indicate that they are special ‘reserved’ words that cannot be used for
      other purposes (so you can’t call a procedure or variable ‘END’).
    </p>
    <p>
      Variables all end with either a ‘%’ or a ‘$’ – Turtle will tell you if you
      forget! Turtle BASIC allows two types of variables:
    </p>
    <table className="help-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>integer</th>
          <td>whole number (name ends in ‘%’)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>string</th>
          <td>sequence of characters (name ends in ‘$’)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      Most of your variables are likely to be integer variables, like a
      transparent box that stores a number. You can look at the box to see which
      number it contains at any time, and you can change the number by assigning
      a new value. In the ‘Olympic rings’ example program,{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">ringsize%</code> is declared by assigning the
      value <code data-language="BASIC">130</code> using the command:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">ringsize% = 130</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Six special integer variables are ‘built in’ from the start, and these are
      called the Turtle’s fields:
    </p>
    <table className="help-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="BASIC">turtx%</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s x-coordinate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="BASIC">turty%</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s y-coordinate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="BASIC">turtd%</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s direction</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="BASIC">turta%</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s angles</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="BASIC">turtt%</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s pen thickness</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="BASIC">turtc%</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s colour setting</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      These automatically change to keep track of the Turtle’s state, and are
      shown above the Canvas.
    </p>

      For a use of <code data-language="BASIC">turtd%</code>, see the ‘Simple
      procedure’ example.
