    <h3>Command Structures</h3>
    <p>
      Selection and ordering of commands is done by <em>sequencing</em>,{" "}
      <em>conditional selection</em>, and <em>looping</em>.
    </p>

    <h4>Sequencing of Commands</h4>
    <p>
      Commands to be performed in sequence are usually placed in the appropriate
      order within the program, e.g.:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">
        COLOUR(GREEN) BLOT(100) PAUSE(1000) COLOUR(RED) FORWARD(450) REM etc.
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>(From the first example program in the Help menu.)</p>

    <h4>Conditional Selection of Commands</h4>
    <p>
      Suppose you want to draw a blot with a given radius (stored as the integer
      variable <code data-language="BASIC">radius%</code>), but only if that
      value is less than 500; do it like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">
        IF radius% &lt; 500 THEN BLOT(radius%) ENDIF
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      If you want to do something different when the condition is not met (e.g.
      drawing a blot with half the radius), extend the{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">IF - THEN</code> structure by adding{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">ELSE</code> and then the new command:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">
        IF radius% &lt; 500 THEN BLOT(radius%) ELSE BLOT(radius% / 2) ENDIF
      </code>
    </pre>

    <h4>Grouping of Commands</h4>
    <p>
      A sequence of commands within an{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">IF - THEN - ELSE - ENDIF</code> structure is
      always treated as a single command. The{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">ELSE</code> and{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">ENDIF</code> words bracket off the sequence of
      commands. (Another possibility is to package them into a procedure.) You
      can also write these on a single line without the{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">ENDIF</code>, like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">IF radius% &lt; 500 THEN BLOT(radius%)</code>
    </pre>

    <h4>Spacing and Indenting</h4>
    <p>
      Unnecessary ‘white space’ is ignored by BASIC, so you can use line breaks
      and indenting to make the structure of your program easy to read. However,
      each statement must be on its own line, unless separated by a colon ‘:’.
    </p>

    <h4>Looping Structures</h4>
    <p>
      BASIC provides three different structures for looping (or ‘iterating’)
      commands. If you know in advance how many times you want to loop – or you
      want to ‘loop over’ a particular range of values (e.g. from 1 to 200),
      then the simplest is a ‘<code data-language="BASIC">FOR</code> loop’ (or
      ‘counting loop’):
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">
        FOR count% = 1 TO 200 FORWARD(count% / 3) RIGHT(5) REM etc. NEXT
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      (From the first <code data-language="BASIC">FOR</code> loop example
      program in the Help menu.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, <code data-language="BASIC">NEXT</code> is used to bracket together
      a number of commands, and indenting is used to show the structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      To count downwards, use <code data-language="BASIC">STEP -1</code> at then
      end (as in the ‘Procedure with parameter’ example program).
    </p>
    <p>
      In a <code data-language="BASIC">FOR</code> loop, the ‘loop variable’
      (here <code data-language="BASIC">count%</code>) is given in turn each of
      the values in the range (here 1, 2, 3, …, 199, 200), and the loop
      instructions are performed each time. So in the example above, a spiral is
      drawn as the Turtle moves forward gradually more and more (as{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">count%</code> increases).
    </p>
    <p>
      If instead of looping a specific number of times, you want to loop through
      some sequence of commands until some particular condition becomes true,
      then you can use:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">
        REPEAT REM command1 REM command2 (etc.) UNTIL REM condition
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The ‘Simple procedure’ example program does this, looping until the Turtle
      is pointing directly north (i.e.,{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">TURTD% = 0</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can loop through a sequence of commands while some
      condition is true (so that it stops when the condition becomes false):
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="BASIC">
        WHILE REM condition REM sequence of commands ENDWHILE
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Things that can be done with a <code data-language="BASIC">REPEAT</code>{" "}
      loop can equally be done with a <code data-language="BASIC">WHILE</code>{" "}
      loop (and vice-versa), but sometimes one is more natural than the other.
      Notice also that a <code data-language="BASIC">REPEAT</code> loop always
      executes the sequence of commands at least once, because it tests the
      condition at the end of the loop. But a{" "}
      <code data-language="BASIC">WHILE</code> loop tests the condition{" "}
      <em>before</em> executing the sequence of commands, and so will not
      execute them even once if condition is false to start with. (For examples
      of the various loops, see the second set of example programs, ‘Further
      commands and structures’.)
