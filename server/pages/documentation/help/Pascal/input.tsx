    <h3>User Input</h3>
    <p>
      The facilities for user input – via keyboard or mouse – are designed to be
      as straightforward and comprehensible as possible, while operating
      strictly through simple processes that are consistent with the workings of
      the <em>Turtle Machine</em>.
    </p>

    <h4>Mouse Position Detection</h4>
    <p>
      The x- and y-coordinates of the mouse’s current position can be found at
      any time by using the special global variables{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?mousex</code> and{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?mousey</code> – these do not require the
      mouse to be clicked.
    </p>

    <h4>Mouse Click Detection</h4>
    <p>
      When a mouse click is performed, the x- and y-coordinates of the click
      position are remembered by the variables{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?clickx</code> and{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?clicky</code>. However to identify the type
      of click, use the variable <code data-language="Pascal">?click</code>,
      which is initially set to a value of -1, but after any click has taken
      place is set to a numerical value of 128 plus additions as follows:
    </p>
    <table className="help-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>if the click was with the left mouse button</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>if the click was with the right mouse button</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>if the click was with the middle mouse button</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>if the shift key was held down while clicking</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>16</td>
          <td>if the alt key was held down while clicking</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>32</td>
          <td>if the ctrl key was held down while clicking</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>64</td>
          <td>if it was a double-click</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      So if <code data-language="Pascal">n := ?click</code> makes{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">n</code> equal to 137 (128 + 8 + 1), this
      indicates that a left-click is currently under way, with the{" "}
      <kbd>shift</kbd> key held down. When the click event is finished, the{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?click</code> value will become negative.
      Thus if <code data-language="Pascal">?click</code> returns a value of
      -137, this indicates that the last click event – now finished – was
      shift+left; the coordinate position of that click can still be identified
      – until the next click takes place – as (
      <code data-language="Pascal">?clickx</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?clicky</code>). On a left-click, the
      variable <code data-language="Pascal">?lmouse</code> records the relevant
      value (as calculated above); likewise{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?rmouse</code> and{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?mmouse</code> record any right-click or
      middle-click. Again, these are all made negative when the click is
      released, so an empty loop like:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">repeat until ?lmouse &gt; 0;</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      waits for a left-click with the mouse. Afterwards,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?clickx</code> and{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?clicky</code> indicate where that click
      event occurred, and <code data-language="Pascal">?click</code> can be
      queried using the bitwise <code data-language="Pascal">and</code> operator
      to discover which special keys were pressed (e.g.{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">if (abs(?click) and 8) &gt; 0</code> will
      test whether <kbd>shift</kbd> was being held down).
    </p>

    <h4>Key Press Detection</h4>
    <p>
      Detecting key presses (rather than typing in of characters) uses the
      variables <code data-language="Pascal">?key</code> and{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?kshift</code>, and the function{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">keystatus</code>.{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?key</code> gives the code of the last key to
      be pressed – these codes can be tested using the special keycode constants{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\alt</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\backspace</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\capslock</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\ctrl</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\delete</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\down</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\end</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\escape</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\home</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\insert</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\left</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\lwin</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\pgdn</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\pgup</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\return</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\right</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\rwin</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\shift</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\space</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\tab</code>, and{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\up</code>, as well as{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\a</code> to{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\z</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\0</code> to{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\9</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\hash</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\equals</code> etc. Keys on the numeric
      keypad have codes <code data-language="Pascal">\\#0</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\#1</code> etc., and function keys{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\f1</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\f2</code> etc. All these stand for numeric
      values (e.g. <code data-language="Pascal">\\return</code> is 13,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">\\escape</code> is 27), but{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">if ?key = eturn</code> is easier to
      understand than <code data-language="Pascal">if ?key = 13</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the mouse-click functions, <code data-language="Pascal">?key</code>{" "}
      becomes negative after the key is released, so{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">repeat until ?key = -\\a</code> will wait
      until the <kbd>A</kbd> key has been released. If you want to identify the
      last key whether it is still pressed or not, use{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">abs</code> (e.g.{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        if abs(?key) = \\a then &#123;commands&#125;
      </code>
      ).
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a key is pressed, the variable{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">?kshift</code> gives its ‘shift-status’,
      calculated in the same way as <code data-language="Pascal">?click</code>{" "}
      (i.e. 128 plus 8 if <kbd>shift</kbd> was down, 16 for <kbd>alt</kbd>, 32
      for <kbd>ctrl</kbd>, and turning negative after the key is released). So
      to test if <kbd>ctrl</kbd> was down on the last keypress, use{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">if (abs(?kshift) and 32) &gt; 0</code>, with{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">and</code> here acting as a bitwise boolean
      operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      To recover the shift-status for the last press of the <kbd>X</kbd> key
      (say), use <code data-language="Pascal">keystatus(\\x)</code>, which can
      tell you (a) whether <kbd>shift</kbd> / <kbd>alt</kbd> / <kbd>ctrl</kbd>{" "}
      were down; (b) whether the <kbd>X</kbd> is still pressed (since{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">keystatus</code> goes negative on release);
      (c) whether <kbd>X</kbd> has been pressed at all (since all of these input
      codes are set to -1 initially, and can be reset to -1 using{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">reset(\\x)</code> etc.).
    </p>

    <h4>Keyboard Input</h4>
    <p>
      The system provides a <em>keyboard buffer</em> to store typed characters.
      Initially this is set to store up to 32 characters, but can be extended
      using e.g. <code data-language="Pascal">keybuffer(50)</code>. To read from
      the buffer into a string, use e.g.{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">s := read(10)</code>, which reads up to 10
      characters (depending on how many are in the buffer).{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">keystatus(\\keybuffer)</code> returns the
      number of characters it contains, and{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">reset(\\keybuffer)</code> flushes it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code data-language="Pascal">s := readln</code> reads a line of text,
      waiting until the <kbd>return</kbd> key is pressed and then making{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">s</code> equal to what has been typed into
      the buffer (discarding the <kbd>return</kbd> character).
    </p>
    <p>
      The function <code data-language="Pascal">detect</code> waits a given time
      for some input to be received (e.g. a specific key pressed), and returns{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">true</code> when that input is received, or{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">false</code> if it is not received in time.
      Thus{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        if detect(\\escape, 5000) then &#123;command1&#125; else
        &#123;command2&#125;
      </code>{" "}
      gives 5 seconds to press the <kbd>escape</kbd> key (meanwhile continuing
      to collect any typed characters in the keyboard buffer). By default, text
      that goes into the keyboard buffer is also ‘echoed’ to the console (below
      the Canvas), along with text that is output (using{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">write</code> or{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">writeln</code>). This behaviour can be turned
      on and off with <code data-language="Pascal">keyecho(true)</code> and{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">keyecho(false)</code>.
    </p>
  </>
