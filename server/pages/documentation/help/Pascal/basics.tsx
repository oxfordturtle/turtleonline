    <h3>Programs and Procedures: the Basics</h3>
    <p>The simplest Pascal programs take this form:</p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        PROGRAM myprog; BEGIN &#123;program commands&#125; END.
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The first couple of Turtle example programs (from the Help menu) are like
      this. But the ‘Olympic rings’ program introduces a global variable: it is
      called <code data-language="Pascal">ringsize</code> and specifies the size
      of the rings. Such variables are ‘declared’ at the beginning of the
      program, like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        PROGRAM myprog; VAR global1: integer; global2, global3: integer; BEGIN
        &#123;program commands&#125; END.
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Complicated programs are usually divided into subroutines, to separate the
      various tasks and make them easier to understand. Pascal has two types of
      subroutine, procedures (which are like mini-programs) and functions (which
      are designed to calculate some value). The ‘Simple procedure’ example
      program has a procedure to draw a ‘prong’ â€“ a line ending in a blot â€“
      and then return to the starting point. Procedures fit into a Pascal
      program after the global variables and before the{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">BEGIN</code> of the main program; they look
      like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        Procedure myprocedure(par1: integer); Var local1, local2: integer; Begin
        &#123;procedure commands&#125; End;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      A procedure can have its own local variables, declared much like global
      variables. But it can also have parameters (or ‘arguments’) that are
      values sent into the subroutine when it is called from the program, and
      given a name within the subroutine (e.g.{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">par1</code> above).
    </p>
    <h4>Reserved Words, Declarations, Types, and Variables</h4>
    <p>
      The words <code data-language="Pascal">PROGRAM</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">BEGIN</code> and{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">END</code> are often capitalized to emphasise
      the program structure, but Pascal actually takes no notice of
      capitalization (so you could write{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">program</code>,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">Program</code> or even{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">PrOgRaM</code>!). These three words are also
      in red here â€“ this is to indicate that they are special ‘reserved’ words
      that cannot be used for other purposes (so you can’t call a procedure or
      variable ‘begin’). As well as variables, a program can use constants to
      give a convenient name to a particular value. Any constants must be
      ‘declared’ even before the variables, like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        PROGRAM myprog; CONST limit = 4; VAR global1: integer; &#123;and so
        on&#125;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Notice that variable and constant declarations must all end with a
      semicolon â€“ Turtle will tell you if you forget! Notice also that while
      constants are given a value when declared (e.g.{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">limit</code> is given the value{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">4</code> above), variables are given a{" "}
      <em>type</em>, to indicate the sort of data that they can store. Turtle
      Pascal allows four main types of variables:
    </p>
    <table className="help-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>integer</th>
          <td>whole number</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>boolean</th>
          <td>true or false</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>char</th>
          <td>single character</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>string</th>
          <td>sequence of character(s)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      Most of your variables are likely to be integer variables, like a
      transparent box that stores a number. You can look at the box to see which
      number it contains at any time, and you can change the number by assigning
      a new value, e.g.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">VAR ringsize: integer;</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      is declared in the ‘Olympic rings’ example program, and{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">ringsize</code> is later assigned the value{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">130</code> using the command:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">ringsize := 130;</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Five special integer variables are ‘built in’ from the start, and these
      are called the Turtle’s fields:
    </p>
    <table className="help-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="Pascal">turtx</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s x-coordinate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="Pascal">turty</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s y-coordinate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="Pascal">turtd</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s direction</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="Pascal">turta</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s angles</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="Pascal">turtt</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s pen thickness</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code data-language="Pascal">turtc</code>
          </th>
          <td>The Turtle’s colour setting</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      These automatically change to keep track of the Turtle’s state, and are
      shown above the Canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a use of <code data-language="Pascal">turtd</code>, see the ‘Simple
      procedure’ example.
